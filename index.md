Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD research scholar at Norwegian School of Economics (Norges Handelsh√∏yskole, NHH). 

My research interests lie in **Macroeconomics** and **Monetary Economics**, with a focus on how household heterogeneity (wealth inequality) affects monetary policy transmission.
